# Row-Reduced-Echelon-Form

It's a very fancy question in linear algebra mathematics of finding the row reduced echelon form and i have implemented the code to find the same
in python. The code is preety long and maybe diffficult to understand. My code passed all the testcases for the certain range of inputs/counstraints.
As provided by our TA's and Prof.  yes the code can reproduce wrong results but can be correct by making the matrix augmented/deaugmented as per 
the question.

Thankyou!

**Happy coding**
